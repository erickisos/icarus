# vscode-irc README

This extension allows to open an IRC channel as a new tab in Visual Studio Code.

## Features

Right now this is VERY barebones and can only open one channel in read-only 
mode.

Since the UI options for VS Code extensions are sparse, I would like to find a 
way to add new features without having to ressort to convoluted hacks before 
continuing development any further.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `irc.server`
* `irc.port`
* `irc.channel`
* `irc.nick`

## Known Issues

## Release Notes
