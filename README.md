# vscode-irc README

This extension allows to open an IRC channel as a new tab in Visual Studio Code.

## Features

Right now this is VERY barebones and can only open channels in read-only 
mode.

Use the **Open IRC** command to be prompted for a server address, port, channel
and nick.

Since the UI options for VS Code extensions are sparse, I would like to find a 
way to add new features without having to ressort to convoluted hacks before 
continuing development any further.

## Known Issues
